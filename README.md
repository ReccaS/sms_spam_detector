# sms_spam_detector
sms_spam_detector is an application developed using Gradio that helps detect spam in SMS messages. It leverages machine learning to classify text messages as either "Spam" or "Not Spam," providing a quick and efficient way to identify unwanted and potentially harmful messages.

# Features
User-friendly Interface: Built with Gradio, the app provides an interactive and easy-to-use interface for spam detection.
Real-time Predictions: Instantly classifies messages as either "Spam" or "Not Spam" based on the input text.
Example SMS Test Messages: Predefined test cases are available for users to see how the application works.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or above
Gradio library
You can install Gradio using pip:


pip install gradio
Running the App
To run the sms_spam_detector application, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:


git clone https://github.com/ReccaS/sms_spam_detector.git
cd sms_spam_detector
Once in the project directory, launch the Gradio app by executing:


python app.py
This command will start a local Gradio interface in your browser, allowing you to input SMS messages and see if they are classified as spam or not.

Example Messages and Prediction Results
Here are some example text messages and their prediction results:

SMS Message	Prediction
"You are a lucky winner of $5000!"	Not Spam
"You won 2 free tickets to the Super Bowl."	Spam
"You won 2 free tickets to the Super Bowl text us to claim your prize."	Spam
"Thanks for registering. Text 4343 to receive free updates on medicare."	Spam
How It Works
The app uses a pre-trained model to evaluate SMS messages.
When a user inputs a message, the model analyzes the text and classifies it as either "Spam" or "Not Spam" based on certain keywords, phrases, and patterns typically associated with spam.
The result is displayed instantly, providing users with immediate feedback on whether the message is safe.
